# Lesson 13: Relative and Absolute

In this lesson, we learn how to use relative and absolute position to arrange elements in a more advance way.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Window vs Page**: "position: absolute" will fix the element at a specific position of the page while using "position: fixed" will fix the element at a specific position of our window view only. 
- **An absolute position placed inside a relative position**: place an absolute position object inside a relative position object will make the parent element become the "page" of the child element while it does not change anything else. Do this to arrange one element in a relative position to the others.
- **z-index**: z-index is used to prioritize the appearance of elements. This avoid the relative element floating on top of the fixed elements.
