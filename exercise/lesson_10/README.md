# Lesson 10: Grid

In this lesson, we will learn about how to use grid to arrange the structure of the page. The key take-away is that we use grid to avoid having mixmatch of spaces between elements. Also, we can use grid to replace display: inline-block. 

## Key Topics Covered

- **Grid arrangement**: Set a pixel count for each element or use fr
- **Row gap and column gap**: Modify the gap between rows and columns instead of using margins.
