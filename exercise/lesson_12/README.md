# Lesson 12: Fixed Position

In this lesson, we will learn how to fix some elements on window while you scrolling using "position: fixed;". The application of it is fixing the location of header, and side bar of your website. Notice, setting the position to fixed will make the element "float" on top of the body.

## Key Topics Covered

- **How to set the position of the element**: using the attributes top, right, bottom, left and also adjusting height and width to get your desired size and position. Notice: top, right, bottom, left is when you want your element to change the size as you change the window's size.
- **Adjust the body accordingly**: Use padding to add space so that your fixed element does not cover the others.
